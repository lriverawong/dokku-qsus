        Our goal at QSUS will always be the same: to inspire innovation and collaboration amongst some of our
        generation’s brightest minds. In doing so, we explore new and exciting ways of striving towards sustainability,
        and use this practice to enact real, positive change in the Kingston community.
      %p
        Our methodology, however, is always changing – right alongside society’s most recent political, economic and
        technological trends. QSUS recognizes the rapidly changing nature of the modern world and uses this to our
        advantage. Not only do we believe in wearing many hats – we thrive in it; and we enjoy creating an environment
        that welcomes open mindedness and versatility. Whether it be in entrepreneurship, conservation, activism,
        technological innovation, or any number of areas – we are always up for a challenge, and we hope you are too.

        “I firmly believe in the idea that if you aren’t trying to change the world, then you just aren’t thinking
        big enough. QSUS is the perfect platform for that – for students who really want to get their feet wet and
        make a difference.”

        We are independent, but we certainly don't work
        alone. A huge part of our agenda is building and   
        maintaining an impressive network of partners from 
        the private sector, academia and government.

        It’s no secret that the world is changing. Amongst rising populations, 
        declining resources, erratic climates and polarizing ideologies; we find
        ourselves in a period of complete global transformation. 
      %p
        As such, the power for change no longer lies with the forces of
        imperialistic globalization, but with those who are willing to
        work together and strive towards a more unified future. 
      %p
        In 2018, our conference will use this idea to inspire delegates to
        become the trailblazers of a generation built on innovation and
        collaboration. As we look towards a better future, QSUS aims to
        unite the Kingston community, strengthen our means of implementation,
        and revitalize the local partnership for sustainable development.
